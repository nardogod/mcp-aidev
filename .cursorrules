# Cursor Rules for MCP-AIDev Projects

## Project Context
This project uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) for orchestrating AI-powered development workflows.

## Development Principles

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
   - Write tests before implementation
   - Ensure all tests pass before marking phase as complete
   - Use pytest for Python projects

2. **Security First**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations
   - Never expose API keys or secrets

3. **Code Quality**
   - Follow PEP 8 for Python code
   - Use type hints
   - Add docstrings to all functions and classes
   - Keep functions small and focused

4. **Phase-Based Development**
   - Each phase should be independently implementable
   - Dependencies between phases should be minimal
   - Update progress after completing each phase

## File Structure

- `src/` - Source code
- `agent/` - LangGraph agent for planning
- `mcp_client/` - MCP client for Cursor integration
- `tests/` - Test files
- `docs/` - Documentation

## MCP Tools Available

- `run_agent` - Plan project phases automatically
- `get_phase` - Get phase specifications
- `list_projects` - List all projects
- `get_project_status` - Get complete project status
- `update_progress` - Update phase progress

## Automatic Implementation

When implementing phases automatically:
- Generate complete, working code
- Include proper error handling
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow the project's existing patterns
- Run tests after implementation

## Common Commands

```bash
# Run agent to plan phases
python executar_run_agent.py

# Execute complete project automatically
python executar_projeto_completo.py

# List projects
python listar_projetos_mcp.py
```

## Notes

- Always check MCP server health before operations
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Keep project descriptions clear and specific
- Update progress after each phase completion
